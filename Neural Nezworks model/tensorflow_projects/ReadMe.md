# TensorFlow Projects

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that focus on implementing neural network models using TensorFlow:

## 1. Regression Model

### Description
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a regression model using TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to predict numerical values based on a given dataset.

### Files
- `01_Neural_Network_regression_with_tensor_flow.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the regression model.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used in this project.

### How to Run
1. Open and run the `01_Neural_Network_regression_with_tensor_flow.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook.

## 2. Classification Models

### Description
This notebook contains implementations of both binary and multiclass classification models using TensorFlow. The aim of this project is to classify data into distinct categories.

### Files
- `02_NN_Classification_tf.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the classification models.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used in this project.

### How to Run
1. Open and run the `02_NN_Classification_tf.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook.
