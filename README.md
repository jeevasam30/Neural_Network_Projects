# Neural Network Projects Repository

This repository contains two main folders:

1. **NN_projects**: This folder contains neural network projects that utilize Keras for implementation, without relying on TensorFlow directly.

2. **tensor_projects**: In this folder, you'll find classification and regression models implemented using TensorFlow.

Each of these folders also includes a `data` sub-folder where the respective datasets are stored.
