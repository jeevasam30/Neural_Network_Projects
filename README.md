# Neural Network Projects Repository

This repository contains two main folders:

1. **NN_projects**: This folder contains neural network projects that utilize Keras API for implementation,The goal here is to understand the baseline models of neural network.

2. **tensor_projects**: In this folder, you'll find classification and regression models implemented using TensorFlow and computer vision models using tensorflow frameworks.
  
3. **Natural_language_processing** : In this folder you can see projects which have been mainly built on the concept of natural langaugae processing 

Each of these folders also may includes a `data` sub-folder where the respective datasets are stored.
